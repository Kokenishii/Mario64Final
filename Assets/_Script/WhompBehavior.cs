//things it does in it's various states

//NOTE 1: This script relies on two game objects, "Whomp Marker A" and "Whomp Marker B," to determine
//what it should walk towards and where it should stop walking and turn around. These two objects should
//be placed at wither side of the Whomp at whatever boundaries you would like to set for it's movement,
//and then assigned to this script in the inspector.

//NOTE 2: The code that governs if the player can be seen by the Whomp is in a script
//attached to the "Whomp Vision Box" game object, which is a child of the base
//Whomp game object
